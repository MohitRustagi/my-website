# website
I am a python developer by profession who had a same thought of building his own website. Finally I made it :P with little efforts.

-Mean stack - Mongo, express, angular and node js
-Used free template on www.startbootstrap.com

Deployed it on heroku free server. You can buy a domain and add it for free in your free cloud space on Heroku.




Heroku is so awesome :)
